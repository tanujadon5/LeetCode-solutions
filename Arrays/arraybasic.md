```c
**An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. 
But elements can be accessed randomly since each element in the array can be identified by an array index.
An array has a fixed capacity and we need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it. Sometimes this will be somewhat inconvenient and wasteful.
Therefore, most programming languages offer built-in dynamic array which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size. For example, we have vector in C++ **
